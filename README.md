# Classes

In this repository, you will practice writing classes.

## Objectives

  - Create and use classes.
  - Write unit tests.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install packages.
Run `yarn test` to run tests.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Get comfortable with the testing framework
  - [ ] Spend approximately 20-30 minutes reading the [Chai documentation](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) - focus on the `expect/should` page.
    - You don't need to read the entire page. Just skim it so that you feel comfortable with what it contains and so you know where to look when you need to find information later.

### 2. Complete the Animal class and tests.
  - [ ] Read all of the tests in `_animals.js` and make sure you understand them.
  - [ ] Get all of the animal tests to pass.

### 3. Complete the rest of the classes in the `src` folder, fixing and adding tests as you go.
  - [ ] Complete the Dog class in `dog.js`.
    - There are 3 bugs in the test file for this class that you will have to fix.
  - [ ] Complete the Poodle class in `poodle.js`.
    - You will have to write tests for this class.
  - [ ] Complete the Cat class in `cat.js`.
    - You will have to write test for this class.

### 4. Add a new class.
  - [ ] Create a totally new class called "Bird".
    - Create a new file for the class.
      - Don't forget to export it!
    - Create a new file for tests.
      - Don't forget to import the Bird class into this file.
      - Write quality tests.
    - Add at least two properties and two methods into the Bird class.
